📊 Dashboard Report (Paragraph)

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of food delivery performance, customer behavior, and restaurant trends. It shows that the majority of orders are successfully delivered, with North Indian and South Indian restaurants contributing the highest number of completed deliveries and very few cancellations. Gold members play a significant role in overall business performance, accounting for the largest share of orders and deliveries, and they show a strong preference for digital payment methods, especially UPI, over cash on delivery. Popular food items such as Biryani, Butter Chicken, Aloo Paratha, and Chole Bhature indicate diverse customer preferences with no single item dominating demand. Premium restaurants like Bukhara and Indian Accent generate higher order quantities, particularly from Gold members, highlighting the impact of loyalty programs on sales volume. The dashboard also reflects the platform’s scale and diversity through high total order volume and a wide range of food items, demonstrating strong customer engagement, efficient delivery operations, and the importance of membership-based strategies in driving growth.
